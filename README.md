# Scaleing-before-dimensionality-reduction
<h2>In Train_UWu5bXk dataset, normalize the value of each column in dataset before execute dimensionality reduction.<h2></br>
<h3>Method:<h3></br>
<p>As the type of data is different in each column, we cannot apply normalization method to entire dataset, hence we do scaling in each column separately.
you can find the execution code in code section. please before run this code, import your dataset in your jupyter or any other IDE.<p>
